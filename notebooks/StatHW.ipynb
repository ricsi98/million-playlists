    "In this assignment I use a dataset that was generated as part of my PhD research topic. The dataset contains music playlists and song recommendations for these playlists generated with two different algorithms. In this assignment I am performing statistical analysis to compare these two algorithms in terms of recommendation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the two recommendation algorithms\n",
    "Algorithm 1. recommends songs based on popularity only - it returns the top K most popular songs every time, regardless the actual songs in the playlist for which we want to recommend fitting new songs. This is a very simple yet powerful approach that is commonly used as a baseline for evaluating recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm 2. uses Skip-Gram with negative sampling to learn meaningful low-dimensional song represenations. The basic idea is that we get song pairs and have to decide whether these come from the original data distribution $P_{orig}$ or a synthetic noise distribution $P_{noise}$. The song pairs of the original distribution are generated by sampling songs from a playlist within a given context window (with size $c$), and corresponding noise samples are generated by randomly assigning songs that never appear together within a context window (with size $c$). To lower computation costs of noise samples we relax the constraint of never appearing together, usually the co-appearance graph of songs is very sparse, so when we select two random songs it has very low probability (although not zero!) that they co-appear in the dataset. This relaxation is proven to work well based on empirical results and is often used to speed up the sampling process. (more details about this method can be found here)"
